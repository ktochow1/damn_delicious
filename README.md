Hello World!!
# Test::Cli

Welcome to your new gem! In this directory, you'll find the files you need to be able to package up your Ruby library into a gem. Put your Ruby code in the file `lib/test/cli`. To experiment with that code, run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt.

TODO: Delete this and the text above, and describe your gem

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'test-cli'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install test-cli

## Usage

This CLI application scrapes reviews based on specific cities off of Indeed.com.
First, type in the name of one of the cities provided, wait for the following list of jobs associated with
each city, and select the number next to the job you're most curious about. A list of reviews will pop up,
and from there you're free to explore more jobs in the same city or elsewhere!

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
